# Web-Scraping-Data-Pipeline
In this lab, you'll implement an industry grade data collection pipeline that runs scalably in the cloud.

Video Game Scraper

This web scraper scrapes online games from the popular online marketplace Steam. The overall goal of this project is to create a web scraper that collects information about any games that it finds (such as name, price, description, images) and stores this information locally so that this information is not lost and the user can later analyse it.
